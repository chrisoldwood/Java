Introduction
============

Sudoku Solver is a utility aimed to help *you* solve Sudoku
puzzles. Although it can provide the solution, this would be
missing the point - that being that it allows you to solve
the puzzle with the space to enter possible answers and
correct mistakes without having to need a pencil and rubber
and a larger sheet of paper... It also does not generate
puzzles, it was expected that you'll already have one of
these and you'll use this to help you solve it.

Getting Started
===============

The first step is to enter your puzzle into Sudoku Solver so
that it can distinguish between the original answers
provided by the author and your answers. It also means you
can start again without needing to re-enter it.

Click the 'New' button, which shows the Sudoku grid where
you enter your numbers. You can either click on a square or
use the cursor keys to navigate from square to square. Then
use the number keys "1..9" to enter the appropriate value.
If you make a mistake you can either press Delete to remove
it or just type the correct value.

You can use the 'Check'
