# Java Applets

These Java applets were the outcome of briefly learning Java in the early 2000s
as a precursor to writing a real-time internet trading platform for local
authorities which used a Java applet on the client-side.

### Img2Src

This applet loads an image file and converts the image pixels into a series of
int values that can be pasted into a static int array defined in a class. For an
example look at the MsgBoxIcons.java class in the framework.

### JLogo

This applet is a sort of IDE for Visually creating "Logo" type programs. It only
resembles Logo though because you control a turtle. It supports some basic
drawing stuff like pen control and forward/turning motions. It also supports
loops and named variables (of type double) to allow you to produce vaguely
interesting patterns. To get around the lack of access to the file system, the
program can be stored and loaded by cutting/pasting from/to the source editor
window.

### Packages - Java Framework Classes

These packages contain all the classes that are common to my Java applets.
Currently it only contains UI classes for creating message boxes and modal
dialogs. The message box is styled to look like a standard Windows one.

### SudoSolver

This applet is an aid to help solve Sudoku puzzles. It provides the ability to
enter multiple numbers into each cell to make it easier to track the possible
answers, and has a 'hint' and 'solve' feature to help you when you're stuck on
the harder puzzles. It also means you don't need a pencil and rubber...
